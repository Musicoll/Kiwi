When Kiwi is executed two windows will appear : the Document Browser and the Kiwi Console.

The Kiwi Console displays messages from the app or from the patcher. You can access the console from the `Window/Console` menu or by typing `cmd` + `k` on Mac or `ctrl` + `k` on Windows or Linux. Messages can be sent to the console through a *print* object from a patcher.

The Document Browser window allows you to view, create and join remote patchers hosted online. To see hosted documents you first need to login.
