## Help patches

To see the help of an object, select it in a patch, then right-click on it and click in the help option. It will open the corresponding help file.

A list of help patches describing how each object works is provided in the documentation accessible from the main application menu `Help/Objects`. Sometimes help patches gather several objects that are functionally linked, for instance *gate* and *switch* or *gate~* and *switch~*.
